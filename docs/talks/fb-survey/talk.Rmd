# COVIDcast

The COVIDcast project has many parts: 
    
1. Unique relationships with partners in tech and healthcare granting us to access to data on pandemic activity
2. Code and infrastructure to build `r col("COVID-19 indicators")`, continuously-updated and geographically comprehensive
3. A historical database of all indicators, including `r col("revision tracking")`, with over 500 million observations
4. A [public API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html) serving new indicators daily (and [R and Python packages](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_clients.html) for client support)
5. [Interactive maps and graphics](https://covidcast.cmu.edu) to display our indicators
6. `r col("Forecasting and modeling")` work building on the indicators

# COVIDcast Indicators (Cont.)

- Available through the [COVIDcast API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html), updated daily
- Most (nearly all) available at the `r col("county level")`
- For a full list see our [signal documentation site](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html) 
- Provide [R and Python packages](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_clients.html) for client support

# This Talk

Today: Our COVID-19 symptom surveys through Facebook. Outline:

- The survey
- Its value as an indicator of COVID activity
- Other data available from the survey

<br>

Upcoming talks: medical claims data, forecast evaluation, etc.

# Our Two Surveys 

Back in March 2020, we began discussions with Facebook and Google about running surveys to collect real-time info on COVID symptoms. In April we launched two surveys: 

- One advertised by Facebook, and implemented on our own CMU platform 
- One run by Google through Google's Opinions Reward app, AdMob, etc.

<br>
Both are `r col("massive")`. But they are are very different:

- Facebook survey: long, and no control over geo-sampling distribution 
- Google survey: short, and full control over geo-sampling distribution

We'll cover the Google survey another time (still very much a work in progress)

# Our Facebook Survey

Through recruitment partnership with Facebook, we survey about `r col("75,000 people daily")` (over 10 million since April) in the United States about:

- COVID symptoms (common and rare)
- COVID testing
- mental health
- social contacts and behavior
- mask wearing (as of yesterday)
- demographics

A [parallel, international effort](https://covidmap.umd.edu/) by the University of Maryland reaches 100+ countries in 55 languages

# Our Facebook Survey (Continued)

- This survey is implemented on Qualtrics, managed by CMU
- Facebook never receives any individual responses
- Designed to take about 10 minutes; about 35 questions
- Questions selected for relevance to forecasting and nowcasting
- But also for research in public health (understanding the pandemic burden)
- Respondents provide ZIP code, so data is available at county level

This is the largest non-Census research survey `r col("ever conducted")` (that we know of)

# Why % CLI-in-Community? 

We ask people to report on their own symptoms, and also if they know anyone locally who is sick. You'd be surprised ... the latter appears to be a lot more valuable!

# An Early Indicator?

Let's take a look at case counts in Miami-Dade, from June 1 to July 15, and compare it to the % CLI-in-community indicator based on our survey

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=7, fig.height=5}
# Fetch Facebook % CLI-in-community signal and JHU confirmed case incidence
# numbers at the county level
start_day = "2020-06-01"
end_day = "2020-07-15"
sympt = covidcast_signal("fb-survey", "smoothed_hh_cmnty_cli", start_day, 
                         end_day)
cases = covidcast_signal("jhu-csse", "confirmed_7dav_incidence_num", start_day, 
                         end_day)

# Function to transform from one range to another
trans = function(x, from_range, to_range) {
  (x - from_range[1]) / (from_range[2] - from_range[1]) *
    (to_range[2] - to_range[1]) + to_range[1]
}

# Function to produce a plot comparing the signals for one county
plot_one = function(geo_value, title = NULL, xlab = NULL,
                    ylab1 = NULL, ylab2 = NULL, legend =  TRUE) {
  # Filter down the signal data frames
  given_geo_value = geo_value
  sympt_one = sympt %>% filter(geo_value == given_geo_value)
  cases_one = cases %>% filter(geo_value == given_geo_value)
  
  # Compute ranges of the two signals
  range1 = cases_one %>% select("value") %>% range
  range2 = sympt_one %>% select("value") %>% range
  
  # Convenience functions for our two signal ranges
  trans12 = function(x) trans(x, range1, range2)
  trans21 = function(x) trans(x, range2, range1)

  # First find the state, find abbreviation, then set title
  state_name = state_census %>%
    filter(STATE == as.numeric(substr(geo_value, 1, 2))) %>% pull(NAME)
  state_abb = state.abb[state.name == state_name]
  title = paste0(fips_to_name(geo_value), ", ", state_abb)

  # Transform the combined signal to the incidence range, then stack
  # these rowwise into one data frame
  df = select(rbind(sympt_one %>% mutate_at("value", trans21),
                    cases_one), c("time_value", "value"))
  df$signal = c(rep("% CLI-in-community", nrow(sympt_one)),
                rep("New COVID-19 cases", nrow(cases_one)))
  
  # Finally, plot both signals
  pos = ifelse(legend, "bottom", "none")
  return(ggplot(df, aes(x = time_value, y = value)) + 
           geom_line(aes(color = signal)) +
           scale_y_continuous(name = ylab1, limits = range1, 
                              sec.axis = sec_axis(trans = trans12, 
                                                  name = ylab2)) +
           labs(title = title, x = xlab) + theme_bw() +
           theme(legend.pos = pos, legend.title = element_blank()))
}

# Produce a plot for Miami-Dade, and add vertical lines
plot_one(name_to_fips("Miami-Dade"), xlab = "Date",
         ylab1 = "Daily new confirmed COVID-19 cases",
         ylab2 = "% of people who know someone with CLI") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2020-06-19")), linetype = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = as.numeric(as.Date("2020-06-25")), linetype = 2)
```

# An Early Indicator? (Cont.) 

Ok, that was just one county... let's look at the top 20 in terms of the rise in case counts:

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10, fig.height=10}
num = 20
geo_values = cases %>% group_by(geo_value) %>%
  summarize(diff = last(value) - first(value)) %>%
  arrange(desc(diff)) %>% head(num) %>% pull(geo_value)

p_list = vector("list", num)
for (i in 1:num) {
  p_list[[i]] = plot_one(geo_values[i], legend = FALSE)
}
do.call(grid.arrange, c(p_list, nrow = 5, ncol = 4))
```

# An Early Indicator? (Continued) 

- Facebook % CLI-in-community indicator is never lagging, `r col("sometimes leading")`
- Similar results hold with doctor's visit indicator (but, remember: latency and backfill!)
- Unfortunately, whether leading-or-not seems to be quite location dependent
- We're working on formalizing these findings currently, via hotspot detection models

# Upcoming Data Streams

New revision of the survey will allow us to calculate new aggregates:

- Test positivity rate, broken down by test reason
- Percentage of population tested in last 14 days, broken down by age, occupation
- Percentage of people *ever* tested
- Types of activities people do outside their homes
- Mask wearing
- Anxiety, depression, isolation

Data to become available this month.

# Access to Survey Microdata

Want to study a problem that can be answered with 10 million US survey responses since April? Possible topics:

- Symptoms reported by people testing positive, stratified by chronic conditions, age, etc.
- Test rates and availability by employment and occupation
- Mental health impacts of interventions
- Disparate impacts on minorities and disadvantaged groups
- ...anything you can think of

Raw response data is freely available to researchers who can sign DUAs to protect confidentiality of responses.

We're building a network of academic and non-profit researchers to learn from the survey.
