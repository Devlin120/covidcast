# What is Delphi

- Formed in 2012, [Delphi](https://delphi.cmu.edu) to "develop the theory and practice of epidemic forecasting, and its role in decision-making"
- Led by Roni Rosenfeld and Ryan Tibshirani, with several participating faculty and graduate students 
- Participated in annual CDC flu forecasting challenges starting in 2013, earned top place in several 
- Awarded `r col("CDC Center of Excellence")` for flu forecasting in 2019 


-  over 40, to support the COVID-19 response
- Added many smart folks from CMU, but also Stanford, UC Davis, USC, Google
- Beyond (before?) forecasting: we've been focusing, now more than ever, on `r col("data")`
- *This problem is so hard that our best weapon is a diversity of data sources*

# COVIDcast Ecosystem

# This Talk

I can't cover all of this! I'll focus on our data sources, our API, and some `r col("basic demos")` ("real" modeling work will be skipped entirely ...)

Outline:

1. Data sources
2. API and client support
3. Dive into symptom surveys

`r col("Reproducible talk:")` all code included

# `r col("Part 1: Data Sources", "white")` {.bigger}

# Severity Pyramid

# What Is This Used For?

- Forecasting, e.g.,
    * Case incidence: for vaccine trial site selection
    * Hospitalizations: for planning and preparedness 
- Nowcasting, e.g.,
    * Situational awareness: testing and resource allocation
    * Decision-making: re-opening criteria, school closures
 - General epidemiological research, e.g.,
    * What behaviors are linked to spread?
    * What symptoms are linked to cases?

# COVIDcast Indicators

# COVIDcast Indicators (Cont.)

- Available through the [COVIDcast API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html), updated daily
- Most (nearly all) available at the `r col("county level")`
- For a full list see our [signal documentation site](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast_signals.html) 
- See also our [R](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcastR/) and [Python](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/covidcast/covidcast-py/html/) packages
